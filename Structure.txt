##Stages:
  1. hit the target with specific velocity given constant 0 acceleration
    solve for:
      time  (distance and acceleration)
      distance  (velocity and time)
      acceleration (given time and distance)
  2. Hit the target below the starting point given constant y acceleration
    solve for:
      final velocity
      initial velocity
      angle
  3. Trajectory equation
    solve for:
      angle
      distance x (angle, distance y, velocity, acceleration)
      distance y (angle, distance x, velocity, acceleration)
      velocity initial (angle, distance x, distance y, acceleration)
      velocity final (initial velocity, angle, distance x, distance y, acceleration)
  4. TBD
