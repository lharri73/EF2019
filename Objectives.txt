##Stages:
  1. hit the target with specific velocity given constant, 0 acceleration
    This one, you just input the final velocity since it won't change
  2. hit the target with specific velocity given constant 0 acceleration
    solve for:
      time  (distance and acceleration)
      distance  (velocity and time)
      acceleration (given time and distance
  //IDEA: describe the derivation of these equations in the description, either in text or in images (for symbols)
  3. hit the target with a specific constant x-acceleration
    solve for:
      time (distance, acceleration, finalVelocity)
      finalVelocity (distance, time, acceleration)
      distance (time, finalVelocity, acceleration)
      acceleration (time, finalVelocity, distance)
  4. Hit the target below the starting point given constant y acceleration
    solve for:
      final velocity
      initial velocity
      angle
  5. Two dimensional acceleration
  6. Two dimensional acceleration given angles of acceleration
      (this is just another step to calculate)
  7. Trajectory equation
    solve for:
      angle
      distance x (angle, distance y, velocity, acceleration)
      distance y (angle, distance x, velocity, acceleration)
      velocity initial (angle, distance x, distance y, acceleration)
      velocity final (initial velocity, angle, distance x, distance y, acceleration)
  8. TBD
