Failure! Hint: The number in the top right is the answer.
Correct!
image images/eqns/velocity_eqn.jpg 100 100
//2
Failure! Hint: Divide the total distance by the time it takes to travel that distance. (Bottom Left Corner)
Correct!
Use the Equations in the bottom left corner to solve for the missing variable.
//3
Failure! Start by writing out what you know. Then use the formula from the bottom left corner to figure out the missing variable.
Correct!
Use the Equations in the bottom left corner to solve for the missing variable.
//4
Failure! Hint: Solve for time using the change in the Y distance and the Y acceleration. Then assume the initial velocity is 0 because the ball is moving from rest.
Correct!
Use the Equations in the bottom left corner to solve for the missing variable.
//5
Failure! Hint: Find time using the Y displacement and Y acceleration, then find initial Velocity using X displacement and X acceleration and time previously found.
Correct!
Use the Equations in the bottom left corner to solve for the missing variable.
//6
Failure!
Correct!
Use the Equations in the bottom left corner to solve for the missing variable.
//7
failure
success

##NOTE: for stage 7, it is possible for the ball to go above the screen, but only above
##We also need to add sin/cos/tan stuff to this...
Use the Equations in the bottom left corner to solve for the missing right variable.

###This file must end with the next stage number, even if it doesn't exist
##otherwise we will get what is essentially a seg-fault
##TODO: Fix this^^ (sketch.js:14-34)
