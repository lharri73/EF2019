Failure! Hint: The number in the top right is the answer.
Correct +5 Points!
The goal of the game is to use the information provided in the top left to hit the target
The equations necessary to solve the problem will be provided in the bottom left. For this stage, enter the inital velocity if the final velocity is given in the top left. 
//2
Failure! Hint: Divide the total distance by the time it takes to travel that distance. (Bottom Left Corner)
Correct +10 Points!
For this stage, you must solve for the missing value using the velocity equation in the bottom left corner
//3
Failure! Start by writing out what you know. Then use the formula from the bottom left corner to figure out the missing variable.
Correct +15 Points!
For this stage, we now have a horizontal acceleration, meaning the veloicty will change over time. Solve for the missing variable using the equations in the bottom left. 
//4
Failure! Hint: Solve for time using the change in the Y distance and the Y acceleration. Then assume the initial velocity is 0 because the ball is moving from rest.
Correct +20 Points!
For this stage, a vertical acceleration has been introduced. The initial vertical velocity is zero, and the target is below the ball. Find the inital velocity required to hit the target.
//5
## These can be negative
Failure! Hint: Find time using the Y displacement and Y acceleration, then find initial Velocity using X displacement and X acceleration and time previously found.
Correct! +20 Points!
This stage happens to take place on a planet where the acceleration is not only in the y direction. There is also a horizontal acceleration.
The initial y velocity is still zero, find the initial horizontal velocity required to hit the target.
//6
Failure! Hint: Same as stage number 5, except you have to find the components for the acceleration. 
Correct! +25 Points!
You're still on the planet with a strange acceleration. This time, rather than being given the components of the acceleration, you're given the direction and magnitude. 
NOTE: the direction is given conterclockwise from the x-axis
//7
Failure! Hint: Use the trajectory equation!
Correct! +30 Points! Press any key to return to Stage 1!
Back on earth with normal acceleration, you must solve for the missing value in the top left using the trajectory equation in the bottom left. For this stage, it is possible for the ball to go above the bounds of the screen, just don't hit the wall!
##NOTE: for stage 7, it is possible for the ball to go above the screen, but only above
##We also need to add sin/cos/tan stuff to this...
//8
###This file must end with the next stage number, even if it doesn't exist
