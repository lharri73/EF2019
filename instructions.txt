The ball hit the target with the incorrect velocityTry again!
Success!
There are 2 objects here, one is a ball (which you will control), and another, a target. The goal is to hit the target with the ball. You will be allowed to change a variety of the ball's properties as the game continues.Your objective and cosntraints will be in the top left corner
For this stage, you must hit the target with the velocity specified in the top left. Use the text box to set the initial velocity in the x direction, then press enter.
//2
Nope, that's not correct
Success!
In the previous stage, you were given the velocity you needed to hit the target at, and there was no acceleration affecting it.
In stage 2, there is not an acceleration, but you will be given 2 of the following values: distance, velocity, and time.You will have to solve for either distance, velocity, or time.
##Yes, this next line is ridiculous. but it makes the spacing nice
Note: always round to 2 decimal places        5.3333 -> 5.33,                             t4 -> 4.00,                                 123.456789 -> 123.46

:-(try again
Success!
Previously, you haven't had to worry about any acceleration or changing the velocity. That is no longer the case.
In this stage, we begin to deal with gravity.Typically, gravity works in the Y direction, but in this stage, it works in the +x direction.
For this stage, you will be given 3 of the following: time, distance, acceleration, final velocityYou will have to solve for one of these values
//4
You've fallen out of the game's bounds.
Success!
In stage 4 you begin to experience gravity as it is on earth: In the -y direction.
In this stage, you will be at a location higher than the target. You will have to enter the velocity that cause the ball to hit the target.
Note: Don't assume you're on earth...Gravity can (and does) change!
Oh, and the target is smaller :-)

###This file must end with the next stage number, even if it doesn't exist
##otherwise we will get what is essentially a seg-fault
